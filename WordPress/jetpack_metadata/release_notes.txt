Lots of improvements in the block editor! We fixed an image displaying issue, a toolbar issue affecting devices set to an RTL language, and made many updates to the Embed block, including enabling WordPress, Instagram, and Vimeo previews and offering options to retry or convert media into a link if it’s not embeddable.

Other updates include a fix affecting .mp4 video on some sites, and streamlining My Site menu labels (“Posts” and “Pages”).
